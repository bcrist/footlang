# Tags
The `#` operator turns any constant expression into a _tag_.  Tags have no effect on the code generated by the compiler, but they are visible through reflection, and so can be used to control code generation.

Tags can be placed on declarations, expressions, and fields.  Multiple tags may be placed on the same target.

## Declaration Tags
Tags on declarations must appear before the declaration's identifier, on the same line or a previous one:
```foot
#"I'm a tag!" my_tagged_decl :: 1234

#.["this decl has multiple tags"]
#1234
tagged_decl_2 :: 4321
```

## Field Tags
Within a struct or union type definition, tags can also be attached to fields.  As with declaration tags, the tag can appear on a previous line, or the same line before the field symbol literal:
```foot
union {
    #"tag, you're it"
    .asdf
    #1234 .field2: f32
}
```

## Expression Tags
When used on the same line as an expression, `#` acts as a binary operator with low binding power.  These are all equivalent:
```foot
((1 + 2) #"tag1") #"tag2"
(1 + 2) #"tag1" #"tag2"
1 + 2 #"tag1" #"tag2"
```
Note that applying a tag does not affect the type or value of an expression, so tags can also be nested:
```foot
#("outer tag" #"inner tag")
```
