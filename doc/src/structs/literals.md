# Struct Literals
A new value of a struct type can be created with the `.{}` operator.  The type of the struct may be explicitly specified to the left, or it can be inferred from the outer context, or an anonymous struct type will be generated by the compiler:
```verdi
x :: S.{} // explicitly typed
x : S : .{} // type inferred
x :: .{} // generated anonymous type: struct {}
```

If the struct has any fields that don't have a default value, they must be initialized within the braces.  This can be done by placing a symbol referencing the field name on the left side of an assignment:
```verdi
.{ .field_name = value }
```
When the value being assigned is only compatible with one of the fields of the struct, the field name may be omitted:
```verdi
.{ value }
```
These strategies may be combined, where some fields are initialized by name, and others by type:
```verdi
.{
    value1
    .field_2 = value2
}
```

When an anonymous struct definition needs to be created, but one or more field initializers are unnamed, their fields will be [anonymous](index.md#anonymous-fields).

When two or more fields are being initialized, they must be separated by either commas or newlines.
