# Union Literals
A new value of a union type can be created with the `.()` operator.  The type of the union may be explicitly specified to the left, or it can be inferred from the outer context, or an anonymous union type will be generated by the compiler.
```foot
x :: U.( ... ) // explicitly typed
x : S : .( ... ) // type inferred
x :: .( ... ) // generated anonymous type
```

Inside the parentheses, exactly one of the union's fields must be initialized.  This can be done by placing a symbol referencing the field name on the left side of an assignment:
```foot
.( .field_name = value )
```
When the value being assigned is only compatible with one of the fields of the union, the field name may be omitted:
```foot
.( value )
```

When an anonymous union definition needs to be created, but the field symbol is omitted, it becomes an [anonymous field](index.md#anonymous-fields).
